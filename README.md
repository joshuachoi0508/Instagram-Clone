OfficeGram is a single-paged image sharing web-app inspired by Instagram. It has Ruby on Rails backend, PostgreSQL database, and React.js with Redux framework on the frontend. The theme of the app is the TV show The Office. Visitors can login as Dunder Mifflin (the demo account) and browse through different characters from the show to test out features!

### Like and comment
A user can like and comment on different images. One user is only allowed to give one like per image but can comment as many times as he/she wishes per image. A like/comment can be removed easily by clicking the like button again/clicking the x button next to the comment.
